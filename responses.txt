"Now, so we're going to be using this talking board. And when you reach the goal, then you're going to get the puzzle."
In this instruction, the teacher is using a token economy to reinforce the student's behavior. The student will receive a reward (the puzzle) when they reach the goal (using the talking board). This type of instruction is used to reinforce desired behaviors and can be used in ABA sessions to teach new skills or reinforce existing ones.
